Previouse Instructions:
Send to my email the testing frameworks you worked on.
I will choose two for you to write a code that performs end to end testing on grabdocs.com. You should decide the functionalities you think need testing.
The grading will be based on:
- the number of features tested
- code cleanliness
- your understanding of the tool
- the max score is 100% but two groups will be get 150% if exceptional work is done.


You will have 2 weeks for this assignment.

A live demonstration will be done in class, showing how the end-to-end testing works, what was tested and your code.

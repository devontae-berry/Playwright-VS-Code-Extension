GrabDocs testing assignment - EXTENDED
*** The deadline has been extended by one week.

Send to my email the testing frameworks you worked on.
I will choose two for you to write a code that performs end to end testing on grabdocs.com. You should decide the functionalities you think need testing.
The grading will be based on:
- the number of features tested
- code cleanliness
- your understanding of the tool
- the max score is 100% but two groups will be get 150% if exceptional work is done.


You will have 2 weeks for this assignment.

A live demonstration will be done in class, showing how the end-to-end testing works, what was tested and your code.

*** This testing will also server as a makeup for your mid-term exam. Everyone will defend individually not as a group.
*** DO NOT UPLOAD CODE. Upload a powerpoint presentation showing details of your code and how it run . The video should be deatailed as to what you did, teh result and the code. Remember I will not grade what I don't see.

This is GrabDocs main features, your grade will depend on how many features you implemented a test for in your code.
